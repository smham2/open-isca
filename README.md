Source code for open-isca
==========================

open-isca is a phishing email generation tool with the sole purpose of training end-users about the dangers of clicking on links in email messages that are unknown or suspicious to the user. This tool is a web application that uses PHP. Future developments will also include database integration.

The code is divided into two sections: **POC** and **main**

**POC (Proof of Concept)**  
This code is the example code used at devsec.smham2.org and serves as a demo of what open-isca can do. This is code is minimal in size and scope and does not have the options that the main code have. Over time some of the features of the main code could be added to the proof of concept. The POC code is available to give you an idea of what is going on behind the scenes.

**Main**  
The main code is the heart of the open-isca application. More features are added into this code and this is the code that is better suited for general use. As features are added, this README will be updated.
